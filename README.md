## Todoist Task Maker.xlsx
Basically an excel spreadsheet that allows you to save a list of tasks so that the next time you have to embark on the same exercise, you know you can just repeat the same set of tasks, with all the metadata.

Some possible use-cases:
 - Travel list
 - Kicking off a new client
 - Starting a new job
 - Moving to a new house

etc.

Feel free to contribute by "ADDING AN ISSUE". If you have a nice template, let me know and I'll add it to the workbook!
